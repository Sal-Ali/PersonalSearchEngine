# PersonalSearchEngine

This project is built on top of a previous school assignment.

The original assignment was to take documents in a folder and essentially mimic the features of a conventional search engine.

My improvements include adding more features, and introducing OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to parse images and 
then more commonly found PDF formatted files.

I have myself implemented my own OCR algorithm in Python (chech out my Naive Bayes Classifier), but naturally the results of open-
source APIs would yield better results, so I used those.
